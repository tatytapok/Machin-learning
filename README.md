Here you can find some practical examples of machine learning (ML) and neural network methods. 
I have collected all the practical knowledge I gained during my university studies and published it here to show my skills and help others who want to learn more about ML. 
You can also find some theoretical sections that explain the basics of practical work within the text files. 
However, they are all written in Russian, so you can translate them if you want. 
Alternatively, you can search for all the theoretical information on Google or YouTube, as there is nothing unique here.
If you have any questions about the materials or need assistance with understanding some theoretical concepts, please don't hesitate to contact me via email at uruipkinaev@gmail.com. 
I check my inbox approximately once a week.
